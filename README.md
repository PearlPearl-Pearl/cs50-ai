# cs50-ai
This repository contains my solutions to the projects taken during the Harvard CS50 AI course.

While all the solutions presented work, I admit that some of them are not the most efficient and I will appreciate any input to help improve them.


You are free to run any of these scripts by yourself to test them out. I'll advise that you download the various dependencies for each project in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts.

A huge thanks to Professor Malan, Brian Yu and the entire CS50 team for such amazing resources.
